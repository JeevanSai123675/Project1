ðŸš€ Project Title: Student Course Management System
ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack: Java, JDBC, MySQL, OOPs Concepts, Collections
I recently completed a mini project on Student Course Management System as part of my academic learning.
This project helps manage student details, course enrollments, and attendance using Java backend with JDBC for database connectivity.
It demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction.

Currently working on integrating HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend to enhance the UI.
ðŸ”— Excited to learn more and improve this project further!
